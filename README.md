About Olist's
Olist is for everyone "who wants to sell more and better" and "who wants to attract new customers". As a business in the e-commerce sector, Olist is an online selling platform for small businesses. On Olist's sign-up page a range of shopkeeper profiles is listed which fits the business model. A strong focus is on attracting more customers through a larger market presence. A user satisfaction report helps to address areas of attention. Olist therefore acts as a service provider which is managing the sales process for the shopkeepers. Olist doen't own any of the offered products and is also not managing shipping or inventory.

Business objectives
The goal of the analysis is to extract information that supports Olist's business objectives. These objectives are: Attracting more shopkeepers by enhancing the service and attracting more end-customers through a broader product spectrum and higher satisfaction. The analysis is part of a business case that is looking into expanding Olist's service to also include logistics and warehousing, something Olist is not offering at the moment.
